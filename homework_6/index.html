        <h4>Why I like Spaghetti and Beef Mince</h4> 
        <p>Now I have to tell you, this is a real proper Bolognese. So it’s not a “chuckit all in the slow cooker” recipe. Softening the onion and browning the beef before transferring it to the slow cooker is a key step, it can’t be skipped!
        It just so happens that my slow cooker has a sauté setting – very handy for browning before slow cooking.However, when I make Bolognese Sauce in the slow cooker, I always make a double batch using 2 lb of ground beef. So if I were to brown the beef in the slow cooker, I’d have to do it in batches anyway because otherwise it would be (very!) overcrowded and the beef would end up stewing instead. So I just brown the beef in a large skillet then transfer to the slow cooker. Well actually, I brown the onion first then transfer that into the slow cooker, then I brown the beef. Simply because of sheer volume – I don’t have a skillet large enough.
